# Simple Sample Sorter 🎵

Enhancing the efficiency of sorting music samples with a swift and user-friendly terminal-based file explorer. 

## Objective 🎯

Develop a terminal-based file explorer using Python's `curses` to expedite the sorting of music samples into a structured file hierarchy. This tool aims to significantly streamline the process, making it quicker and more intuitive for users to manage their music samples.

### Planned Features 
- **Tab-Switching** : Seamlessly switch between the new virtual hierarchy and the filesystem for efficient navigation.
- **Flagging Files** 🚩: Mark files from various directories to move them simultaneously. Selection of the sample's category will be facilitated through an interactive up/down arrow interface.
- **Global Settings** ⚙️: Customize settings such as all-caps filenames, general file name format, and an option to prompt for the pack name.
- **Hierarchy Management** : Capability to reload previous hierarchies for ongoing projects.
- **Startup Tutorial** : An introductory guide on startup to familiarize users with the tool's functionality.

## Current Progress 🚧

The project is under active development, with several key functionalities already implemented. Progress has slowed as I am focusing mainly on university projects.

### Source Directory Structure 📂
```
└───src
│ dcs.py # File decorator constant characters
│ file_util.py # File utilities for filesystem operations
│ main.py # Main application entry point
│ names.py # Labels for prompts and application constants
│ panes.py # Pane management for UI
│ widgets.py # UI widgets
│ w_id.py # Global widget identification numbers
```
This structure is designed to keep the codebase organized and modular, facilitating easy updates and feature additions.

Contributions welcome.
